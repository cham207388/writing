What is the truth? Whenever you engage in a dialogue/discussion/argument, it's important to understnd
what the other person is saying and their rationale behind their statements. When someone is talking about
their feelings, it's important to listen to them and try to understand their feelings, empathize with them,
and not take it personally. However, if you're claiming about facts, this person might not be in the right 
headspace to understand the facts as they are emotionally charged with their feelings. 

Feelings are subjective, but facts are objective. Truth is perspective-based because people have different experiences and knowledge
that influence their perspective which leads to different truths: mine versus yours.

What do you learn from stories? Stories are a collection of events that have meaning to the narrator.
They are a way of making sense of the world around them. Stories are also a way of communication,
and they can be used to convey information, express feelings, and share ideas.

Often, stories are used to justify actions or decisions. The conclusions we draw from stories can be used to justify
our actions or decisions. However, the conclusions we draw from stories can be biased and not based on facts.

Feelings, truth, facts, stories, and actions are all intertwined. And they are all subjective and influenced by perspective.
It's not black and white. 

If I'm driven by feelings and you're driven by your truth, it can be difficult to understand each other.
