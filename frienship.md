# Friendship

Friendships offer profound enrichment to our lives, yet they require us to be attentive and proactive. Be cautious of friends who presume to dictate your contributions to the relationship. This often reflects a disregard for personal boundaries and may indicate a sense of entitlement. To assess if you exhibit these traits, reflect on your response or reaction when your requests are denied. How do you feel when a friend does not answer your call? Is unavailable to attend your function? Think about it.

If you find yourself missing someone, take the initiative to reconnect. Avoid assuming you’re the only one valuing the relationship, as such assumptions can jeopardize meaningful connections.

Connecting with someone you care deeply about—whether through a call, text, or prayer—can bring immense joy. However, if you find yourself drifting apart from a friend or if a friendship ends, resist the urge to cast blame. It’s healthy to end relationships that no longer serve you, provided you remain honest with yourself and others about your reasons.

## Conclusion

Remember, your significance in any relationship should not be measured by what you receive. Often, we have all we need for fulfilling relationships right in front of us, if only we recognize and nurture these resources.
